# Reflection
My purpose for creating Vidshare was to get familiar with nested documents in MongoDB/Mongoose, and learn how to upload files using npm multer. 
Technologies that were applied to build this project include: React, Axios, React-Router-Dom, multer, JSON web tokens, Bootstrap, and B-Crypt. 

How I used these technologies:

- Utilized React.js to produce many interconnected components for a social media dashboard
- Implemented the Bootstrap library to quickly construct high quality Forms
- Designed a login and registration that employs JSON Web Tokens to store data in browser cookies that enables the application to verify authorized users
- Employed the Mongoose library to accurately mimic one to many relationships in MongoDB
- Used the the node package module multer to seamlessly upload video files to a folder in the application to be displayed on the dashboard
